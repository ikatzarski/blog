Hi! My name is Ivan. Welcome to my blog about Software Engineering, DevOps, tech in general, and who knows what else.

I decided to start blogging to strengthen my learning and, hopefully, to share knowledge. Writing about concepts you have learned should help clarify your understanding and reveal what you need to improve. That is the goal! Let us see how it goes.

## About Me

I started my education in Economics. I never truly enjoyed Economics. It was not my passion, but I realized that halfway through my course. I decided to complete it. When I did, I was at a crossroads. Should I continue on this path and get a job, or should I start doing something I enjoy? I always loved computers. I regret the fact that I did not study something related to IT in the first place. So, I started a masterâ€™s degree in Software Development. I enjoyed it incredibly. That is why I did so much better than during my first course.

I was on my path to becoming a Software Engineer. While on this curvy road, I realized that many software problems can be solved by anyone with general IT knowledge. Nowadays, you only need to know about Stack Overflow and how to copy and paste to refer to yourself as a Software Engineer. Of course, this is an oversimplification, but copy-pasting still results in loads of questionable code and disturbing engineering. So, how do you start writing good code?

I have no idea, but I think code is just the result. I want to be a good Engineer, not just a good Coder. I believe that involves a lot more than just writing software. You need to be able to: communicate with people, to listen and to express your thoughts, to be compassionate, patient, to share your knowledge with others, to have a great hunger for knowledge, to like solving problems, and so much more. There is always a lot to learn, and there is always something to improve.

Well, that is me. I hope you find helpful things in my blog.
